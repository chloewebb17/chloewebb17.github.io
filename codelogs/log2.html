        <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    </header>

        <p>In CSS, which is the "design" aspect of basic coding, measuring units can be divided up into two categories: <b>Absolute and relative units.</b><i>Absolute units</i> are the same every time they are used, like pixels. <i>Relative units</i> are proportional to their constraints, like em which is a number times the size of the font currently being used. Let's dive into some different measuring units now.</p>
