        <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    </header>

        <p>In CSS, which is the "design" aspect of basic coding, measuring units can be divided up into two categories: <b>Absolute and relative units.</b> <i>Absolute units</i> are the same every time they are used, like pixels. <i>Relative units</i> are proportional to their constraints, like em which is a number times the size of the font currently being used. Let's dive into some different measuring units now.</p>

    <header>
        <h2>VW and VH</h2>
    </header>
    
        <p><i>Viewport Width</i> (VW) and <i>Viewport Height</i> (VH) have pretty self explanatory names. They are both relative units. They work in percentages, so 50vw or 50vh are going to be half of the size of the screen you are using. This is extremely helpful when you are coding for multiple platforms and need assets to stay the same size proportionally on the screen. Smart coders and designers can use this to their advantage.</p>

    <header>
        <h2>PX and PT</h2>
    </header>

        <p><i>Pixels</i> (PX) are tiny squares that make up your screen. They are technically 1/96th of an inch. Pixels are most often used to display images- each pixel is one color, and the more of them there are, the higher resolution the image. When creating art digitally, pixels allow for organic, painterly effects. Some people consider pixels relative because they are dependant on your screen resolution, however, that doesn't apply to CSS. A pixel is a pixel no matter how small! <i>Points</i> (PT) are slightly larger at 1/72 of an inch and are also absolute units. They are commonly used in typography to define font size and letter kerning (distance). Points were first invented for printing in the renaissance, hence the seemingly arbitrary definition. Way back when, people had to make actual physical letter carvings to print with in dozens of sizes for all sorts of uses.</p>

    <header>
        <h2>EM and REM</h2>
    </header>

        <p><i>Em</i> does not stand for anything. Boo! It is a relative unit that refers to the size of the font currently being used. Its name is in reference to the height of the capital letter 'M'. The number of em is multiplied by the size of the font. Ergo, 2em is twice the size of the font, 3em is 3 times, and so on. <i>Root em</i> (REM) scales to the size of the root element, aka the default browser font size. Most websites have the same default size, so rem can be reliable when em isn't.</p>
