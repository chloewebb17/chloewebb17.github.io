			<p>The Pacific Rhododendron are shrubs with large, leathery leaves that creep along the undergrowth of the Pacific Northwest. Sometimes they stay small, and sometimes they sprout into a tree dozens of feet tall. They tend to prefer damp soil that drains well, and stay under the shadows of their neighbors, the Western Hemlock and the Douglas Fir. However, they also do well in "disturbed" environments such as roadsides where they can prevent erosion.</p>

			<p>Rhodies are beloved by many for their impressive size and gorgeous pink flowers, and can be found in many a garden in the PNW. Like many other rhododendrons, they react to the health of their soil visibly, indicating pH and moisture through color and curling leaves. Such an expressive flower can be an interesting experiment to grow.</p>

			<p>These plants have little nutritional value to animals and can be toxic at certain quantaties, but they provide shelter for smaller creatures and their flowers have been used ceremonially and as decorations for centuries. In 1893, it was donned the title of Washington State flower for the Chicago World's Fair, an honor it still has to this day.</p>
